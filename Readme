This file is to explain how to use the codes. The codes are executed in the following order

1. Select_complex
	This module is select the required complexes from all the antibody-antigen complexes
	downloaded. For further information, refer to the module.

2. AAC_2
	This module is to extract the amino acid sequence and all the possible contacts between 
	antibody and antigen in each complex.

3. AlignmentConstraint
	This module is to eliminate the redundency by using the hierachical clustering method.

4. FrameConstraint
	This modle is to generate the cores of different match-types.

5. GenerateNegativeSamples
	This file is to generate random negative samples. The size of the negative samples is the
	same as the positive samples of the same math-type.

6. RBFN_coverage
	This module is to perform cross validation to select the best parameters for the RBFN

7. Train_RBFN_coverage
	This module is to train the RBFN model by using the best parameters and the training sets.

8. Test_RBFN_coverage
	This module is to test the trained RBFN model on two tasks:
		a. The ability to discriminate the positive cores from the negative cores
		b. Switch the positions of the antibody and antigen pairs, see if the model can
 			tell them from the normal cores.
9. Integrated_model
	This module is to perform the same tasks as in Test_RBFN_coverage on the integrated model.

10. Extract_mutation_pairs
	This module is to extract the mutation pairs according to the information in Formated.ods

11. Predict_affinity
	This module is to predict whether the mutations increased or decreased the affinity on 		basis of the extracted mutaion pairs.

12. Charts_and_statistics
	This module is draw the curves and calculate the statistics.

13. Some_bais_fuctions
	This module contains some frequently used functions

14. Train_loss:
	This module contains different training methods and loss functions.
